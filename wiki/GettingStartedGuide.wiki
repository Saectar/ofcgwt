#summary Getting Started Guide for OFCGWT (beta6)
#labels Featured

= Introduction =
This guide will outline required steps needed to get a GWT application working with OFCGWT. Basic Java and GWT programming skills will be assumed, and that you are familiar with using Eclipse as your development environment.
_Note: whilst using Eclipse is assumed, instructions should work generically for any other kind of development environment_

== Requirements ==
The following items are what is required to be successful with OFCGWT (_though earlier version might work, they have not been tested_).

To begin you will need...
 * GWT 1.5.2 
 * Java 1.6 
 * OFCGWT beta6
 * Eclipse 3.4 

= The 5 Major Steps =
== 1. Create an Eclipse GWT Project ==
_Unless you know what you are doing, copy the project names etc exactly as provided._
 a) Using GWT tools at the command line, create a new GWT project `ProjectCreator -eclipse ofcgwttest -out ofcgwttest`

 b) Still with GWT tools command line, create a new GWT application `ApplicationCreator -eclipse ofcgwttest -out ofcgwttest com.gwttest.client.Test`
These two steps will have created a new Eclipse project setup for GWT.
== 2. Copy Test.java from OFCGWT Download ==
To speed things up, we are going to copy in a java source file provided with the beta6 download of OFCGWT.
 a) Copy the `Test.java` file included in the beta6.zip file into the `ofcgwttest\src\com\gwttest\client` directory overwriting the existing file.
== 3. Add the OFCGWT Jar ==
== 4. Configure Eclipse ==
== 5. Launch  ==
